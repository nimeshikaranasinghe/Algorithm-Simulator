# Algorithm-Simulator

The simulator can work as a e-learning tool for beginners to the algorithm field. User can upload input values to the system or allow system to generate random number sequence. Then it simulates each line execution of the algorithm.

This program simulates below algorithms,
1.  Bubble Sort
2.  Insertion Sort

LIMITATIONS
--------------

This Algorithm Simulator was built using Java in NetBeans IDE. Older versions of Java might not support the program,  Please use an updated version of Java to run the program.
• Can do sorting for only integer numbers.
• Can't do sorting with negative numbers.
• Can provide up to 12 numbers.
• Can have maximum of 4 digits for each integer
